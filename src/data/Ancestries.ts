        'description': 'A vast race whose tribes have long splintered, Humans have evolved over an age from primal roots to become the most pervasive and adaptable civilization in the modern world. Humans are a varied lot, marked by differences in language, culture and art. They value reason and intellect, but also reward avarice and opportunism. If there is one shared trait amongst Humans, it is a burning desire to impose their will upon others, often using religion to justify their vicious ideologies. In times of old, it is said that this vainglorious nature brought about a terrible age of suffering and exile when Humankind attempted to exert its power over the gods themselves and failed. Human society is highly adaptive and intensely political, quickly assimilating the ways of others and providing advancement to the ambitious and the talented. Their societies are dominated by thinkers and tricksters, clerics and charlatans, politicians and provocateurs. They huddle together in walled cities, proclaiming themselves conquerors over the vast wilderness beyond the gates. Their tenacity and expansionism has made humans the most populous Ancestry. It also makes them repugnant in the eyes of most Elves, who often kill Human perpetrators that dare enter their sanctuaries on sight.',

This desire extends into an intense yearning for unbridled perfection. Because of this, Dwarves take great pains in their craftsmanship, laboring for weeks over the smallest of trinkets. It is because of this singular dedication that Dwarves often display a mercurial disposition. It also explains the tendency to binge drink when their work is complete, as the frazzled Dwarf is momentarily freed from the hold of their inner muse. Forever consumed by complex tasks, Dwarves are also notoriously unhygienic, allowing their matted beards to grow to such great lengths that they must tuck them into their belts. Amongst their families, called Clans, there is a deep fascination with the length of oneâ€™s beard (beer-soaked as it may be), for it is a respected symbol of tireless dedication. Dwarves are not warlike by nature, but their endless pursuit of perfection makes them ideal soldiers. Those Dwarves who feel compelled to pursue a life of warfare bear particularly contemptuous grudges against foes who exhibit a shameful lack of drive and focus. Their tireless concern over seemingly petty matters makes Dwarves the butt of many japes, thus giving birth to many popular stereotypes concerning their lack of personality, dulled insight and austere resolve. Orange mohawks, tattoos that look akin to the scribbling of a madman and two massive axes to grind are amongst the most common of these images.',

Avid connoisseurs, there is no doubt that Elves are particularly disdainful of those who do not apply the same exacting standards in their own choices. Standing in imperious opposition to the long-bearded folk who dwell below the earth, Elves reside in the magnificent beauty of sanctuaries far removed from other civilizations. Perhaps there is some truth to the divine origin of Elves, for they uniformly appear ageless. There are many examples of Elves whose years span several Human lifetimes, and it is even believed that some have attained true immortality. Not surprisingly, Elven longevity is often stunted by the gripping reality of a merciless world. Elves who have left their Kindred by choice or forced exile often fall victim to an eternal grief, doomed to dwell among the crude masses of the \u2018lesser folk\u2019.

Marriage is rare and their families are small. Offspring are often treated as chattel to be put to work, and love is rarely a factor when it comes to coupling. Children of such unions, should they prove to be useless, are abandoned to the forest. The only reason some Gnomes wed is to erase some great shame upon themselves, forced to make amends by marrying themselves into families they\u2019ve greatly offended. It\u2019s not to say that some couples have not grown a certain fondness for one another (for misery loves company), but mutual disgust rarely creates a productive relationship. Siblings are treated worse still, seen as bitter rivals or treacherous enemies. Gnomes are gifted, however, with a singular expertise in tinkering.
